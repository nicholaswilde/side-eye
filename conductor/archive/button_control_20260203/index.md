# Track: Firmware: Hardware Button Integration & Backlight Control

**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** TBD
**Link:** [./index.md](./index.md)

## Synopsis
The Waveshare ESP32-C6-GEEK includes an onboard "Boot" button. This track leverages that button to add interactivity to the device, allowing users to manually cycle information pages or toggle the backlight to save power/reduce distraction. It also introduces a "Screen Saver" timeout feature.
