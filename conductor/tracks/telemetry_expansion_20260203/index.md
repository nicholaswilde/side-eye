# Track: Feature: Expanded System Telemetry

**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** TBD
**Link:** [./index.md](./index.md)

## Synopsis
This track expands the data monitored by SideEye beyond simple identity (IP/MAC). It introduces CPU Load, RAM Usage, Disk Usage, and Uptime monitoring. This requires updates to the Host gathering logic, the USB Serial protocol, and the Firmware UI (implementing a paged display).
